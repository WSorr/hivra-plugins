# hivra-plugins

External WASM plugins repository for Hivra.

This repo contains plugin packages and build/release tooling only.
Core app runtime, ledger, and host execution stay in the main Hivra repository.

## Principles

- Modularity: plugin code is separated from core/runtime code.
- Determinism: plugin contracts are versioned and explicit.
- Downward dependencies only: plugins depend on host API contract, not vice versa.

## Layout

- `contracts/`: versioned host API contracts consumed by plugins.
- `plugins/`: plugin sources and per-plugin manifests.
- `scripts/`: local build/packaging scripts.
- `dist/plugins/`: generated plugin zip artifacts (`plugin/manifest.json` + `plugin/module.wasm`).

## Quick start

1. Install Rust with target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. Build all plugin zip packages:

```bash
./scripts/build_all_plugins.sh
```

3. Install produced zips into Hivra app from `dist/plugins/`.

## First plugin included

- `hivra.contract.bingx-trading.v1` test package scaffold
  - deterministic/stub wasm module
  - package manifest for Hivra plugin installer
